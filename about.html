          In addition to publishing the first substantial information on the only surviving Sunshade of Re in the archaeological record from Tell el-Amarna (maps, inscriptions, etc), the book contributes in other ways. The EES team excavated at the site of Kom el-Nana in the 1980s and 1990s, they discovered several thousand fragments of decorated stone relief. Their findspots are directly associated with their original placement in the walls of a temple. As all other examples of Amarna period relief are preserved completely out of context due to post-Amarna demolition, the reconstructions obtained in this work represent the first artistic program that can confidently be associated with a specific building and a specific time frame.  The methods used to obtain the reconstructions are transferrable to any reconstruction project of Egyptian art, and the Intersecting Chord Theorem can be applied to pottery analysis and other round objects.

            <p> Hieroglyphic texts from Kom el-Nana are reconstructed as well as the relief decoration. These texts prove the site of Kom el-Nana is the Sunshade of Re of Nefertiti and the rwd ʿnḫw itn, one within the other, nesting-doll fashion. Further analysis also establishes new information regarding how Akhenaten and Nefertiti provided for the mortuary cults of the elite at Tell el-Amarna. The utilization of Nefertiti as a “sex goddess,” or the source of cosmogonal creation, formed an environment in the Sunshade at Kom el-Nana where the rebirth of not only the divine king, but also his entire court, was assured. The final chapter presents a new understanding of the status and role of Nefertiti in Akhenaten’s religion; the ‘misconceptions of power’ section uses interdisciplinary methods to argue against the prevalent characterization of Nefertiti as a proto-feminist.
